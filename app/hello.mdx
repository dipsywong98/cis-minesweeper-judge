[Minesweeper](https://www.google.com/search?q=minesweeper&rlz=1C1YTUH_zh-HKHK1048HK1048&oq=minesweeper&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgAEAAYjwIyBwgAEAAYjwIyDwgBEC4YQxiDARixAxiKBTIHCAIQLhiABDIHCAMQABiABDIHCAQQLhiABDIGCAUQRRg8MgYIBhBFGDwyBggHEEUYQdIBCDUxMTlqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#cobssid=s) is an interesting game, why not automate it?

## Instructions

You need to expose a POST endpoint `/minesweeper`, that accept a list of url that will lead you to different minesweeper game and you need to respond the array of mine positions in each game in `[rowIndex, columnIndex]` format, sorted from left to right, then top to bottom, where both row and column are 0-indexed. You may check [/sample](/sample) for more examples

## Sample post body

<pre>
  [
    "{MINESWEEPER_UI_URL}#MiwyLGtBPT0=",
    "{MINESWEEPER_UI_URL}#Myw0LHBBQT0="
  ]
</pre>

## Sample response

```json
[
  [[0,0], [1,1]],
  [[0,0], [0,2], [1,1]]
]
```

## Scoring

Tiny map worth 2 points (width == height == 5), 5 of them

Beginner map worth 5 points (width == height == 9), 2 of them

The rest worth 10 points each, (15 < width < 61, 15 < height < 33), 8 of them

Good luck~
