## Instructions

You need to expose a POST endpoint `/api/minesweeper`, that accept a list of url that will lead you to different minesweeper game and you need to return the array of mines position in each game in `[rowIndex, columnIndex]`, sorted from left to right, then top to bottom, where both row and column are 0-indexed.

## Sample post body

```json
[
  "http://link.to.minesweeper/#MiwyLGtBPT0=",
  "http://link.to.minesweeper/#Myw0LHBBQT0="
]
```
## Sample response

```json
[
  [[0,0], [1,1]],
  [[0,0], [0,2], [1,1]]
]
```

## Scoring

Tiny map worth 2 points (width == height == 5), 5 of them

Beginner map worth 5 points (width == height == 9), 2 of them

The rest worth 10 points each, (15 < width < 61, 15 < height < 33), 8 of them

Good luck~
